      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is Base64?</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data
        (like images or files) into an ASCII string format. This encoded string
        uses a set of 64 different ASCII characters to represent the data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Base64?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Base64 encoding is used in various applications, particularly when you
        need to include binary data in environments that handle text. Here are
        some common reasons for using Base64 encoding:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Embedding Data in Web Pages:</strong> Base64 is often used to
          embed image data directly into HTML or CSS files. This can reduce the
          number of HTTP requests made by the browser, which can improve the
          load time of a web page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> When transmitting binary data over
          text-based protocols (like JSON, XML, or email), Base64 ensures that
          the data remains intact without modification during transport. It
          avoids issues that can arise from character encoding mismatches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplified Handling:</strong> Base64 encoding can simplify
          data handling in systems that are designed to process text data but
          not binary data. For instance, some web services and APIs require
          Base64 encoding for file uploads or data exchanges.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How Does Base64 Work?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Base64 encoding works by dividing the input data into chunks of 24 bits
        (3 bytes). Each 24-bit chunk is split into four 6-bit groups. Each 6-bit
        group is then mapped to a character in the Base64 alphabet. This results
        in an encoded string that is approximately 33% larger than the original
        binary data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Example</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Suppose you have an image file you want to include directly in your web
        page. Instead of creating a separate HTTP request to fetch the image,
        you can convert the image to a Base64 string and embed it directly in
        your HTML:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-hidden">
        <code>
          &lt;img
          src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...&quot;&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
